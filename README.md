# Machine Learning Labs

This repository contains four lab assignments implemented using the **Zoo Dataset** and **House Pricing Dataset**.

## LAB 1
- Dataset Used: **Zoo Dataset**
- Description:  
  Lab 1 focuses on initial data exploration and visualization using the Zoo Dataset.  
- Status: **Reuploaded**

## LAB 2
- Dataset Used: **Zoo Dataset**
- Description:  
  Lab 2 builds upon Lab 1 with further analysis and implementation of machine learning concepts and preprocessing  on the Zoo Dataset.  
- Status: **Reuploaded**

## LAB 3
- Dataset Used: **Zoo Dataset**
- Description:  
  Earlier Lab 1 and Lab 2 were performed on House Price Dataset but files were reuploaded in this lab because individual datasets were given to each student.  
- Status: **Reuploaded**

## LAB 4
- Datasets Used: 
  - **House Pricing Dataset** – Linear Regression
- Description:  
  Lab 4 demonstrates: 
  - Prediction using **Linear Regression** on the House Pricing Dataset  
- Status: **ReUploaded**

- ## LAB 5
- Datasets Used:  
  - **Zoo Dataset** – Logistic Regression 
- Description:  
  Lab 5 demonstrates:
  - Classification using **Logistic Regression** on the Zoo Dataset 
- Status: **Renamed**
